# Notes on learning Vim

This is very much a **work in progress** as I am but a young padawan.

There are _TONS_ of great resources on learning how to use Vim effectively. Here's a sample:

- http://derekwyatt.org/vim/tutorials
- run `vimtutor`, here's [the text you'll work through](http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/teaching/unix/vimtutor)
- [openvim](http://www.openvim.com/) - beginner friendly and runs in the browser
- [vim adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/)
- [learn-vim](https://github.com/damassi/learn-vim) - more notes
- [vimcasts.org](http://vimcasts.org/)
- [VimAwesome](https://vimawesome.com/)


### One-offs

(everything is a one-off!)

- [DBEXT](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=356) - allow VIM to access several databases
- [Tim Pope's AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/267vrv/i_am_tim_pope_crafter_of_plugins_ama/)
- [The Vim Learning Curve is a Myth](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-vim-learning-curve-is-a-myth) - Ben Orenstein (vimlord)
